		# The Intest Manual and Source Code
		
		This is the home page for documentation and human-readable source code of
		Intest, a command-line tool for testing other command-line tools.
		
		This page is hosted on the Github Docs area of the Intest repository, at
		https://github.com/ganelson/intest. Download and build instructions are there,
		not here.
		
		To get a sense of Intest and what it does, see //intest: Manual//.
		
		But if you're here to look under the hood, or you want to fix a bug or
		add a feature, a good place to begin is //intest: How This Program Works//.
		
		Intest is presented as a "web", or "literate program", powered by //inweb//.
		Those new to literate programming can find much more information about it there.

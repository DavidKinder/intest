This GitHub project was written as a literate program, powered by a LP tool
called Inweb. While almost all programs at Github are open to inspection, most
are difficult for new readers to navigate, and are not structured for extended
reading. By contrast, a "web" (the term goes back to Knuth: see
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">Wikipedia</a>)
is designed to be read by humans in its "woven" form, and to be compiled or
run by computers in its "tangled" form.</p>
